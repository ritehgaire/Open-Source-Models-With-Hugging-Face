    "Pipeline Initialization: We initialize the SAM model pipeline for mask generation, specifying a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's SlimSAM-uniform-77.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mask Generation: The SAM pipeline generates segmentation masks, and these masks are displayed using a helper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster Inference: For faster inference, we focus on a specific region of the image using a single 2D point. The processor converts the image and point into model inputs, which are then passed to the SAM model to produce a more focused mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-processing: The predicted masks are post-processed to adjust their size to match the input image's dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "IoU Scores: The Intersection over Union (IoU) scores are displayed to evaluate the segmentation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
